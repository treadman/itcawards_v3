<b>CID Explanation</b> 
<br><br>
The Customer Identification Number (CID or CIN) is a three or four digit number that is unique to each card. This additional security feature is designed to protect the consumer by helping to ensure the card is present during the purchase. It is printed only on the card, never on any receipts or statements. The number is verified by the card issuer during the purchase.
